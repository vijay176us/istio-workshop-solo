# Operationalizing Istio

In this second of a two-part series of workshops on Istio service mesh, we dig into how to “day 2” Istio in your organization to improve speed of delivery and reduce mean time to recovery (MTTR). We focus on things like integrating with CI/CD and observability tooling, zero-downtime control-plane upgrades, how to rotate certs and integrate with PKI, running on VMs, and ending with multi-cluster deployments.

We've cultivated a lot of this knowledge from working organizations across the world and helping them operationalize Istio.  We cover the following topics in this second workshop:



* Zero downtime upgrades in production
* Automating config with Fluxcd and Flagger
* Integrate with APM/observability tools
  * mtls with prometheus
  * splunk?
  * metrics merging (TODO: Move some bonus from previous)
* Certificate rotation and PKI integration
* Bridging to VMs
* Multi-cluster deployments

## This workshop is currently WIP/Coming Soon
